Global State Management (RTK)

Redux Toolkit (RTK): The modern, simplified way to use Redux — comes with slices, reducers, and built-in async thunks.

Intersection Observer

A browser API (often used in React via hooks) to detect when an element enters or leaves the viewport — commonly used for lazy loading, infinite scrolling, and triggering animations on scroll.

Component Portalling

A React feature (ReactDOM.createPortal) that lets you render a child component into a different part of the DOM tree, outside its parent hierarchy — often used for modals, tooltips, and dropdowns.

Persisting Data

Storing data beyond component lifecycle — e.g., in localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, or persistent Redux/Zustand stores. Useful for keeping user preferences or session data even after page reloads.

Optimistic Update

A UX technique where you update the UI immediately after a user action (as if the request succeeded), then roll back if the API call fails — often used with libraries like React Query or Redux Toolkit Query.

TanStack Router & SWR (for Data Fetching)

TanStack Router: A new type-safe router for React apps — similar to React Router but with built-in data loading, validation, and type safety.

SWR: A React hook library for data fetching (“stale-while-revalidate”) — it caches data locally, shows cached data instantly, then fetches fresh data in the background.

Progressive Web Application (PWA)

A web app that behaves like a native app — installable, offline-capable, fast, and reliable. In React, typically implemented with a service worker and manifest (e.g., via create-react-app’s PWA setup or Vite PWA plugin).
